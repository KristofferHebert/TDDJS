TDD is think, red, green and refactor....

a bit of test code, then production code, then run 


write tests backwards, rapid fine grain cycle

allot of time and practice

Think -> Red -> Green -> refactor

Just get the test to pass, then improve in small steps

Then move to think

Why TDD Works

Expressing your intentions twice, most errors are caught

Tiny steps - constantly check your hypotheses

node programes can be broken into piences


jake auto runs all functions starting with test

unit tes
